CASE 15. TOZAN'S SIXTY BLOWS

Tozan went to Ummon and Ummon asked him where he had come from. Tozan answered, "From Sato!" Then Ummon asked, "Where were you then during the Summer?" Tozan answered, "At Hoji Temple in Konan Province." Ummon further asked Tozan, "When did you leave there?" Tozan replied, "I left on August 25." Un-mon told Tozan, "You deserve 60 blows, but I will forgive you today!"

The next day Tozan knelt and deeply bowed to Ummon and said, "Yesterday you forgave me the 60 blows, but I still do not understand in what respect I was wrong." Then Un mon told Tozan, "You are really a good-for-nothing rice eater! No wonder you wandered around Konan and Kosei for nothing!" At this very moment, Tozan was awakened.

Mumon's Comment:
Ummon had Tozan feed on the genuine fodder of Zen, showed him the one way of living activity, and helped him from becoming extinct. All night long Tozan swam in the waves of Yes and No until he got nowhere. When the dawn broke, again Tozan went to Ummon to be awakened. After all Tozan was not so seasoned.

Now I will ask you: Did Tozan deserve 60 blows? If you say Yes, then not only Tozan, but everyone also deserves 60 blows! If you say No, Ummon is a swindler. If therefore you understand this clearly, Tozan and you breathe the same air!

The lion roughly teaches her cubs,
She kicks them away and the cubs jump.
Ummon's thrown words hit right on Tozan's heart,
While Ummon's first arrow is light, the second arrow hits deep.
