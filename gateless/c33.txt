CASE 33. NEITHER MIND NOR BUDDHA

A monk asked Baso, "What is the Buddha?" Baso replied, "Not mind, not Buddha."

Mumon's Comments
If anyone understands what Baso said, he has mastered Zen.

If you meet a sword master on the road, give him the sword.
Unless you meet a poet on the road, do not offer a poem.
If you meet a man, tell him the three quarters of the Way, 
and never tell him the rest.
