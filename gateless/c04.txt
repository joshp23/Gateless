Case 4. WAKU'AN'S "WHY NO BEARD?"

Waku'an (looking at Bodhidharma's picture) complained, "Why has that Barbarian no beard?"

Mumon's Comment:
If you study Zen, you must study it with all your heart. When you attain enlightenment, it must be true enlightenment. When you really meet Bodhidharma face to face, then you finally have gotten it right. However when you start explaining it with words, you have fallen into duality.

Do not explain your dream
Before a fool.
The barbarian has no beard,
How could you add obscurity to clarity?
