CASE 34. NANSEN'S NO WAY

Nansen said, "Mind is not Buddha. Knowledge is not the Way."

Mumon's Comments:
Growing old, Nansen forgot to be ashamed. With his stinking mouth open he spread the scandal of his own house (such as knowledge is not the Way) to others. However, few appreciate their indebtedness to him.

When the sky is clear the sun appears,
when rain falls, the earth becomes moistened.
How wholeheartedly he explains, 
how few have faith in him and his words.
